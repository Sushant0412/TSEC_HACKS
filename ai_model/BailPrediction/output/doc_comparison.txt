Free copyright notice: drafting notes 
This is a copyright statement (or copyright notice) template, designed for use on a 
website. 
Copyright is one of the cornerstone intellectual property rights. Although websites 
as such do not attract copyright protection, they are made up of works that do. For 
instance, literary copyright will protect both website code and natural language 
materials published through the website, while artistic copyright will protect 
photographs, illustrations and logos. 
Using this copyright statement template, the website operator asserts ownership of 
copyright in the website and the materials on the website, and sets out the basis 
upon which others may use the website. 
In addition, the copyright statement incorporates special provisions relating to 
copyright infringement and copyright-related notifications. 
The template copyright statement may be used on its own, or it may form part of a 
website's terms and conditions of use. 
Section 1: Credit 
Section: Free documents licensing warning 
Optional element. Although you need to retain the credit, you should remove the 
inline copyright warning from this document before use. 
Section 2: Copyright notice 
A copyright notice is an assertion of ownership. 
Copyright notices usually take the form specified in Article 3(1) of the Universal 
Copyright Convention (although the UCC itself is now of very limited significance): 
"Any Contracting State which, under its domestic law, requires as a condition of 
copyright, compliance with formalities such as deposit, registration, notice, notarial 
certificates, payment of fees or manufacture or publication in that Contracting 
State, shall regard these requirements as satisfied with respect to all works 
protected in accordance with this Convention and first published outside its territory 
and the author of which is not one of its nationals, if from the time of the first 
publication all the copies of the work published with the authority of the author or 
other copyright proprietor bear the symbol © accompanied by the name of the 
copyright proprietor and the year of first publication placed in such manner and 
location as to give reasonable notice of claim of copyright." 
It will be rare for a website owner to be the sole proprietor of all the copyright in a 
website. For example, the software code used to run the website may belong to 
another person. For this reason, the notice here refers also to licensors.

Optional element. 
Section 5: Report abuse 

Will there be a special procedure (which could be as simple as a designated email 
address) for reporting abusive conduct or materials on the website? 
Websites that allow the publication of user-generated content should incorporate an 
abuse reporting procedure. The existence of such a procedure may help the website 
operator to take advantage of certain defences that may be available in respect of 
such user generated content. 
Section 5.2 
Optional element. 
• 
How can users report unlawful and unwanted materials and activities on the 
website?
