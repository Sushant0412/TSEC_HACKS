The document does not explicitly violate any of the listed laws.  However, the completeness of the application depends on the information filled in the blanks.  Crucially,  the filled-in sections must accurately reflect the details of the offense, the accused's history, and the stage of the investigation to ensure compliance with the principles of bail and the CrPC.
